**Allows Glific to auto translate content in the default language of flow editor, and have the translations populated in in the other languages enabled in the Glific instance.**

The feature is in beta version and can be enabled/ disabled for any given organizationâ€™s Glific instance upon request in the [discord](https://discord.gg/CAUgdQsZAd) channel or via writing to spoc from the Glific team.

**Overview**

1. Create flow in default language
2. Have translations auto populated for all the languages selected in your Glific instance
3. Have the flow exported as CSV (with or without translations) to be proofread and corrected by language experts
4. Import translations as CSV
5. The process (automatic translations -> export translations -> import translations) chain can be used as a whole or in parts depending on your needs

**How it works**

1. Translation Button is provided in the UI (bottom left) 

2. This gives 4 options

Auto translation: takes the content in the default language flow and adds translations in all the enabled flows 

Export with translations: takes the content in the default language flow, adds the translations in the languages enabled and exports the flow and content as a CSV, for further proof reading/ correction work to be done by language experts. 

Export without translations: Exports the content present into CSV format. This can be used to add translations manually, and then import the CSV with translated content in the flow directly.

Import translation: Way to import the proofread and corrected content from export translation as a CSV and have the content in the given Glific flow updated.
